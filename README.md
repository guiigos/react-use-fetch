# React Hook Fetch

This project was created to exemplify the use of a custom hook for requests in a React application. The hook is designed to simplify the process of making requests to services by implementing paging support and allowing the hook return to be typed according to the service being executed. In addition, this technique makes it possible to use several request implementations simultaneously. The api chosen for testing was [**https://swapi.dev**](https://swapi.dev).
